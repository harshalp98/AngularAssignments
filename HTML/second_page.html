<p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds for good reasons. They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. 
And they’re amazingly versatile.As a herding dog, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the 
preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting. The German Shepherd was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020, and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel 
Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.

<p>For many enthusiasts, the Labrador Retriever remains one of the most popular all-round dogs worldwide. It’s thought that Labrador Retrievers originated from the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, where fishermen used dogs of this appearance to retrieve fish. 
The breed as we know it today, however, was established by the British in the early 1800’s. The Labrador Retriever, often abbreviated to Labrador or Lab, is a breed of retriever-gun dog from the United Kingdom that was developed from imported Canadian fishing dogs. 
The Labrador is one of the most popular dog breeds in a number of countries in the world, particularly in the Western world. A popular disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid those with blindness or autism, act as a therapy dog, 
or perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies.

<p>The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.
Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling, and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. 
William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.
Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.</p>
